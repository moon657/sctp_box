# sctp-box
This project contains a very simple SCTP client/server application, used for testing purposes. I use it to generate some traffic over an SCTP association.

You need libsctp-dev (for debian) or lksctp-tools-devel (for redhat) installed in order to build the source.

WARNING!!!

Please note that this code is for testing purposes only! It is not meant to be production ready and I do advise not to use it in real-life projects without adding proper error handling!
